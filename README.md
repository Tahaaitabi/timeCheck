# timeCheck 

timeCheck is a simple React based time managemnet web app, to manage employees and projects.

The plan is to have a simple, easy to use and intuitive ui, that anyone can use.

timeCheck is a direct response to my mother's need for a similar application which she can use to migrate all her paper notes and employee records to one digital place.
Originally I looked for a similar app online that was free and simple to use, but I didn't find one so I decided to give making timeCheck a go. 
 
This project is open source and If you would like to add to it, you know what to do.

I don't normally do much in react or JS for that matter ( mostly worked with PHP for web apps ) but since I'm broadening my horizon I decided React 
it is for this one. I'll be treating this as a 'learning project', as well as an actual app that I'd like to eventually refine for my mum and anyone else to use.
